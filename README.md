# csv-url-analysis

This is a coding challenge that I completed as part of an internship hiring process. I am very proud of what I have made and as such decided to put it on github. The challenge was to create software which can read in a set of URLs, connect to those URLs, and then process data from those URLs in CSV format. The data includes people's firstname, lastname, and age.

The data processing that needed to be done includes finding the median, mean, and someone at the median. Although this is simple, I believe that I created a very fast and optimal solution to this problem in C.
